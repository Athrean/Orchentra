### Contract-first DevOps operations runtime.

Open-source, terminal-native. Every capability is a typed `Operation` exposed over two surfaces from one registry: a CLI for humans and an MCP server for external agents (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf). Trust-boundary enforcement lives in the runtime, not the caller.

## What is Orchentra

Orchentra is a contract-first DevOps operations runtime. Every capability — fetching workflow logs, posting a PR comment, searching code — is a typed `Operation` (Zod-validated input/output, declared trust class, single handler) registered once and exposed over two surfaces: the `orchentra` CLI for humans, and an MCP server for external agents like Claude Desktop, Cursor, and Windsurf. Both call into the same registry, so the same operations show up wherever the engineer already works. Webhooks (CI failures, Sentry alerts, cron ticks) record every run as an **execution** with a tree of **nodes**, and the web dashboard is a read-only projection of that graph.

This is **not** a Datadog/Grafana replacement, a "PR fixer" SaaS, or yet another alerting product. The wedge is the operations contract, the graph, and the terminal.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Athrean/Orchentra.git
cd Orchentra
bun install
orchentra mcp serve   # stdio MCP server, ready to wire into an MCP client
```

To wire the stdio server into an MCP client, add an entry to its `mcpServers` config that runs `orchentra mcp serve`. See your client's docs for the exact config-file location:

- Claude Desktop — `claude_desktop_config.json` <!-- TODO: link once docs page lands -->
- Cursor — `~/.cursor/mcp.json` <!-- TODO: link once docs page lands -->
- Windsurf — MCP settings panel <!-- TODO: link once docs page lands -->

An HTTP transport behind bearer auth (Phase 1B, shipped) makes the same operations reachable from a hosted endpoint.

## Status

| Phase | Description                                                        | Status              |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------- |
| 1     | `executions` + `nodes` schema (generalize from `incidents`)        | shipped             |
| 1A    | Operations contract + stdio MCP server (`orchentra mcp serve`)     | shipped (#295)      |
| 1B    | HTTP MCP transport + bearer auth + hosted Worker scaffold          | shipped (#298)      |
| 2     | Execution kinds: Sentry `alert` + `cron`                           | shipped             |
| 3     | `orchentra graph <executionId>` + `orchentra why <nodeId>`         | shipped (#306–#310) |
| 4     | Web becomes read-only projection + cross-execution diff            | shipped (#235–#240) |
| 5     | Next adapter (deploy gating, runbook automation) — gated on demand | future              |

Side-shipped: per-org LLM config (multi-provider), live agent investigation timeline, CLI Pro/Max OAuth on macOS (Keychain auto-detect), in-TUI login + model picker, theme registry (6 built-in palettes incl. solarized + WCAG-AAA high-contrast), pre/post tool-use hooks (drop-in `.orchentra/hooks.json`), multi-line input modal, per-workspace fingerprinted sessions, slash-command aliases.

## How it works

```
Trigger arrives
  ├── GitHub workflow_run webhook   → execution.kind = 'ci_failure'
  ├── Sentry alert webhook           → execution.kind = 'alert'
  └── Cron tick                       → execution.kind = 'cron'
        │
        ▼
  Agent loop spawns nodes
   ├── tool_call:  fetch logs, read files, list commits, search code
   ├── tool_call:  pattern memory lookup
   ├── decision:   root-cause hypothesis + confidence
   └── writeback:  PR comment, check run, fix patch
        │
        ▼
  Same graph rendered in both surfaces
   ├── CLI:  orchentra graph <id>   →  ASCII tree
   ├── CLI:  orchentra why <nodeId> →  inputs + rationale
   └── Web:  /dashboard/exec/[id]   →  live timeline + node detail
```

Cross-execution diff (`/dashboard/diff`) lines up two executions for postmortems and A/B comparisons.

## Surfaces

**CLI (primary).** Interactive Ink TUI — REPL, slash commands (`/login`, `/doctor`, `/graph`, `/why`, `/issue`, `/pr`, `/model`, `/theme`, `/skills`, …), short aliases (`/t`, `/sum`, `/h`, `/cls`, …), arrow-key model + theme + repo pickers, in-TUI Anthropic OAuth login, multi-line input modal that activates at ≥5 wrapped rows, `ctrl+x ctrl+e` to edit current input in `$EDITOR`, native `--output-format json` for diagnostic verbs, resume model, per-workspace fingerprinted sessions, optional pre/post tool-use hooks via `.orchentra/hooks.json`.

**MCP server.** `orchentra mcp serve` exposes the operations registry to external MCP clients (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf) over stdio. Same operations the CLI verbs hit, validated by the same Zod schemas, with trust-class enforcement at dispatch. An HTTP transport + bearer auth + hosted Cloudflare Worker scaffold ship as Phase 1B.

**Server.** Hono backend — webhooks (`workflow_run`, Sentry), cron tick, agent loop with multi-provider LLM (per-org config), Postgres-backed job queue with retry + dead-letter, idempotent two-tier dedup.

**Web (read-only).** Next.js dashboard — live agent timeline (WebSocket), execution graph view (kind-agnostic tree), node detail, cross-execution diff. No write paths.

## Investigation tools

The agent has typed tools for: workflow logs, commit + diff inspection, file reads, PR/issue listing, code search, pattern memory across past executions. Skills (`SKILL.md` files) ship reusable prompts as first-class slash commands.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) >= 1.3
- PostgreSQL >= 17 (or Docker)
- GitHub OAuth app credentials
- An LLM credential — OpenRouter key, Anthropic API key, or Claude Pro/Max subscription (CLI only, macOS auto-detect)

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Athrean/Orchentra.git
cd Orchentra
bun install
```

### Configure

```bash
cp orchentra.yml.example orchentra.yml
```

Edit with your credentials:

```yaml
github:
  webhook_secret: 'your-webhook-secret'
  token: 'ghp_xxx'
  oauth:
    client_id: 'your-github-client-id'
    client_secret: 'your-github-client-secret'
    redirect_uri: 'http://localhost:3001/auth/github/callback'
  repos:
    - 'my-org/api'
    - 'my-org/frontend'

llm:
  api_key: 'sk-or-xxx'
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5'
```

### Database + run

```bash
bun run db:generate
bun run db:migrate
bun run dev
```

Server: `http://localhost:3001` · Web: `http://localhost:3000`.

## CLI

```bash
orchentra                                       # interactive TUI
orchentra doctor                                # environment preflight (auth, DB, repo)
orchentra mcp serve                             # stdio MCP server exposing the operations registry
orchentra graph <executionId>                   # ASCII tree of nodes for an execution
orchentra graph <executionId> --output-format json
orchentra why <nodeId>                          # walk parent chain, print inputs + rationale
orchentra why <nodeId> --output-format json
```

### REPL slash commands

Core: `/help` (`/h`, `/?`), `/status` (`/st`), `/clear` (`/cls`), `/exit` (`/q`), `/model` (`/m`), `/theme` (`/th`), `/cost`, `/compact`, `/diff` (`/d`), `/version` (`/v`), `/restart`, `/config` (`/cfg`).

Workspace: `/init`, `/repos` (`/repo`), `/triage` (`/t`), `/summarize` (`/sum`, `/summary`), `/clean` (`/cleanup`), `/scan`, `/commit`, `/pr`, `/issue` (`/iss`), `/graph`, `/why`.

Auth: `/login` (`/li`), `/logout` (`/lo`), `/auth` (`/whoami`), `/reauth`.

Tools: `/skills`, `/mcp`, `/doctor` (`/doc`), `/session`, `/resume`, `/export`, `/env`.

### Pre/post tool-use hooks

Drop a `.orchentra/hooks.json` into a repo to fire shell hooks around every tool call inside that workspace's REPL session:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "hooks": [
    { "event": "pre_tool_use", "tools": ["Bash"], "command": "./scripts/audit-bash.sh" },
    { "event": "post_tool_use", "tools": ["*"], "command": "./scripts/log-tool.sh" }
  ]
}
```

Pre-hook non-zero exit blocks the tool call with stderr surfaced to the user as the reason. Post-hook stdout becomes a user-visible annotation. Hooks reload only on CLI restart by design.

- **Anthropic auth:** Pro/Max subscription auto-detect on macOS, env precedence, opt-out, troubleshooting. <!-- TODO: link once docs/cli/anthropic-auth.md lands -->
- **Skills:** frontmatter schema, discovery precedence, argument substitution, allowed-tools syntax, hot reload. <!-- TODO: link once docs/cli/skills.md lands -->
- **Examples:** [`examples/skills/`](examples/skills/) — drop-in `SKILL.md` samples (`/incident`, `/deploy`).

**macOS Pro/Max users:** if you already use Claude Code, just run `orchentra` — your subscription is picked up from the system Keychain on first request, no extra login needed.

Skills quick start: drop a `SKILL.md` at `<repo>/.orchentra/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, restart the CLI (or `/skills reload`), invoke `/<name>`.

## Self-hosting

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Starts PostgreSQL and the Orchentra server. Mount your `orchentra.yml` — compose handles the rest.
